# Questions
These may or may not be relevant to the report.

* What does it mean for the magnetic field to rotate if it is rotationally symmetric around the dipole axis?

I guess there are variations in the magnetic field (making it deviate from the symmetry) arising from the structure of Saturn's magnetic core, and it is really the core that is rotating and causing the magnetic field variations to rotate. However I've read that saturn's magnetic field is axisymmetric.

* How does the magnetic field generation in Saturn work? (MHD dynamo)

* What exactly are the mechanisms that make Saturn's magnetospheric plasma corotate with the planet?

Charged particles gyrate about magnetic field lines, but in reality there are no "lines", only a continuous vector field. But if the magnetic field varies in magnitude in the angular direction then this might carry the particles somehow, via grad-B drifts maybe. Gravitational drifts are too small (electrons drift about 56 micrometres per second in the orbital direction at Titan's orbit, positive ions drift *against* the orbit)

* How is Titan's induced magnetosphere formed?

* What are pickup ions?


# Terminology
If you are unsure about a word used in the sources and find out what it means then you can describe it here.

* The **ram** side of an object moving in a surrounding plasma or gas is the side where the particles are colliding with the object, and the **wake** side is the opposite side where a vacuum can form at high enough relative speeds.
* The **nose** of a magnetosphere is the region facing the external plasma flow, where the distance from the body to its magnetopause is the smallest. This is on the opposite side of the **magnetotail**.
* **Kronian** means "relating to Saturn" and **Jovian** means "relating to Jupiter".

Chapter 7 is about planetary magnetospheres and section 6 in the chapter is about interactions with moons.

A magnetosphere is a region around a body in space which is partially shielded from external plasma flow by its own magnetic field exerting magnetic pressure against the flow. However, even bodies with no intrinsic magnetic field can form cavities in the plasma flow which have properties that are similar to true magnetospheres. The magnetopause is the surface defining the boundary of the magnetosphere. The term magnetosphere was originally defined as a region above the Earth's ionosphere, but the term has since expanded to include similar phenomena around other bodies in space, including moons. 
## Fundamental planetary science -- Jack J. Lissauer & Imke de Pater (2019)
A planet or moon that has an ionosphere will form an induced magnetosphere if charged particles are flowing past it (section 7.2.4). This induced magnetosphere shields the body from the external magnetic field. Titan in Saturn's magnetosphere is an example of this.

The interior of Saturn is fluid metallic hydrogen which is conductive (section 7.4.2). It is generally assumed that Saturn's magnetic field is produced by a process called "magnetohydrodynamic dynamo". Saturn's magnetic dipole moment is nearly exactly in the same direction as its angular velocity (geographic north and south poles coincide with the magnetic north and south poles) (section 8.2.3 and 7.3).

## Interaction of Titan's ionosphere with Saturn's magnetosphere -- Andrew J. Coates (2009)
This review focuses on particle measurement data from the Cassini flybys of Titan in 2004.

Titan has no internally generated magnetic field, but it has an ionosphere within a nitrogen-methane atmosphere. The moon is almost always within Saturn's magnetosphere, meaning it is (partially) shielded from the highly energetic solar wind. The closest Titan is to Saturn is $a(1-e)\approx 19.68 R$ where $R$ is the radius of Saturn. According to *Fundamental planetary science*, the magnetopause of Saturn is located at $19R$ at the sun-facing side. Since solar activity varies, this point probably also varies with time. The magnetic field drapes around the planet, so the moon only has a chance of entering the magnetosheath at this point.

There are two flows of charged particles across Titan. One is from the Sun and one is from Saturn's magnetospheric plasma. The plasma corotates with Saturn, which at titan's orbit (about 20 saturn radii) implies that it is orbiting faster than Titan is, or than what would be expected if the particles were simply following keplerian orbits (show this mathematically and quantify it). This means that the ram side of this plasma flux is in the opposite direction to the moon's velocity rather than in the same direction, at least in an inertial reference frame fixed to Saturn. The flow of particles from the sun and from the magnetospheric plasma have two different directions which change during the local day on Titan.

## Solar system magnetospheres -- Blanc, M., et al. (2004)
This article is from 2004 right before the Cassini flybys of Saturn, so the information is not completely up-to-date. They list some questions for the Cassini mission to answer, so it would be interesting to see if these questions are answered in other sources which discuss the Cassini observations.

Section 5 is about the interactions between satellites and the magnetospheres of giant planets and 5.3 is specifically about the interactions of Titan with Saturn's magnetosphere.

There are several sources and sinks of neutral and charged particles inside Saturn's magnetosphere. The sources include Titan's and Saturn's neutral atmospheres, their ionospheres, Saturn's rings and inner icy moons (sputtering), and the interstellar and solar winds. Saturn's magnetosphere actually consists mostly of neutral particles. Neutral particles follow keplerian orbits until they collide or get ionized by radiation or collisions with energetic ions or electrons.

The plasma of the magnetosphere co-rotates with Saturn due to friction with its atmosphere and ionosphere. It is mostly concentrated at the equator. However, while the rotation speed of ions increases with radial distance, the rotation speed of neutral particles decreases slowly (more slowly than $\sqrt{\mu/r}$?).

Titan forms a torus of ions (mainly $\text{N}^+$, $\text{N}_2^+$, $\text{H}_2\text{CN}^+$) around Saturn by releasing them via its plasma wake. This was detected by the Voyager 1 flyby in 1980.

## The interaction between the magnetosphere of Saturn and Titan's ionosphere -- Andrew F. Nagy, et al (2001)
This paper presents a 3D MHD simulation of the interaction between Saturn's magnetosphere and Titan's ionosphere. Before the Cassini flybys. 

Variations in the solar wind cause compression and expansion of Saturn's magnetosphere, meaning Titan can sometimes be outside the magnetosphere although it has not been observed yet. When it is outside the magnetosphere, Titan's ionosphere interacts with the solar wind directly leading to very different conditions.

They study three different classes of ion species; light, medium and heavy. In the results they present plots of number density of these different species as well as plots of the magnetic field and plasma speed around Titan. These are nice images to include in the report.

The results of the report might be slightly inaccurate since the gyroradius of the ions is large meaning the MHD model might exclude some observed details.
