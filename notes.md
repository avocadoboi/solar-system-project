# Questions
These may or may not be relevant to the report.

* What does it mean for the magnetic field to rotate if it is rotationally symmetric around the dipole axis?

I guess there are variations in the magnetic field (making it deviate from the symmetry) arising from the structure of Saturn's magnetic core, and it is really the core that is rotating and causing the magnetic field variations to rotate.

* How does the magnetic field generation in Saturn work? (MHD dynamo)

* What exactly are the mechanisms that make Saturn's magnetospheric plasma corotate with the planet?

Charged particles gyrate about magnetic field lines, but in reality there are no "lines", only a continuous vector field. But if the magnetic field varies in magnitude in the angular direction then this might carry the particles somehow, via grad-B drifts maybe. Gravitational drifts are too small (electrons drift about 56 micrometres per second in the orbital direction at Titan's orbit, positive ions drift *against* the orbit)

* How is Titan's induced magnetosphere formed?


# Terminology
If you are unsure about a word used in the sources and find out what it means then you can describe it here.

* The **ram** side of an object moving in a surrounding plasma or gas is the side where the particles are colliding with the object, and the **wake** side is the opposite side where a vacuum can form at high enough relative speeds.

## Fundamental planetary science -- Jack J. Lissauer & Imke de Pater (2019)
A planet or moon that has an ionosphere will form an induced magnetosphere if charged particles are flowing past it (section 7.2.4). This induced magnetosphere shields the body from the external magnetic field. Titan in Saturn's magnetosphere is an example of this.

The interior of Saturn is fluid metallic hydrogen which is conductive (section 7.4.2). It is generally assumed that Saturn's magnetic field is produced by a process called "magnetohydrodynamic dynamo". Saturn's magnetic dipole moment is nearly exactly in the same direction as its angular velocity (geographic north and south poles coincide with the magnetic north and south poles) (section 8.2.3 and 7.3).

## Interaction of Titan's ionosphere with Saturn's magnetosphere -- Andrew J. Coates (2009)
Titan has no internally generated magnetic field, but it has an ionosphere within a nitrogen-methane atmosphere.

There are two flows of charged particles across Titan. One is from the Sun and one is from Saturn's magnetospheric plasma. The plasma corotates with Saturn, which at titan's orbit (about 20 saturn radii) implies that it is orbiting faster than Titan is, or what would be expected if the particles were simply following keplerian orbits (show this mathematically). 

## Solar system magnetospheres -- Blanc, M., et al. (2004)
This article is from 2004 right before the Cassini mission, so the information is not completely up-to-date. They list some questions for the Cassini mission to answer, it would be interesting to see if these questions are answered in other sources which discuss the Cassini observations.

Titan produces an induced magnetic field in its orbit inside Saturn's magnetosphere.
